Here is an analysis of some of the key cases from both a client and server-side perspective, and how they could impact cheat detection and anti-cheat systems:

Case 6 (Read Memory)

    Client: Allows reading any game memory address. Can be used to identify player positions, stats, items etc.
    Server: No direct impact, but enables cheats that use memory reading like wallhacks and ESP.
    Detection: Pattern of reading player/entity positions could trigger detection.

Case 15/16 (Write Memory)

    Client: Allows modifying game memory. Can directly alter things like player health, stats, position.
    Server: No direct impact, but can greatly affect game state and entities on client side.
    Detection: Unexpected changes to stat values on client side could indicate cheating.

Case 18 (Set Key-Value)

    Client: Stores cheat configuration data. Enables tweaking cheats.
    Server: No direct impact.
    Detection: None directly, but can identify cheat users by presence of tweak files.

Case 23 (Cheat Codes)

    Client: Activates built-in cheat behaviors like god mode, no clip, super jump.
    Server: No direct impact, affects client side game state.
    Detection: Irregular player movement, stats could trigger detection.

Case 30/31 (Remote Connection)

    Client: Connects to remote cheat server to send/receive data.
    Server: Enables real-time manipulation of game from server.
    Detection: Network traffic to known cheat server IPs can identify cheaters.

Case 47 (Process Hiding)

    Client: Hides cheat process memory and code from detection.
    Server: No direct impact.
    Detection: Scanner resistance indicates high likelihood of cheating.

So in summary, the client-side impacts enable powerful cheats, while the server-side interactions and detection resistance make cheats harder to detect and ban. Many approaches like analyzing game memory, network traffic, player statistics, program behaviors can identify cheaters. Anti-cheat systems need to employ multilayered detection to combat these powerful cheat tools.
